      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <div id="overview">
        Rainstorm is a Rain World TTRPG created by [Rivu](rivu). It is designed to be intuitive and extensible, allowing for diverse strategies without being unnecessarily complex.
        It is based on Monsoon and will probably feel somewhat similar if you have played that before.
        <br/>
        Contibutions are welcome! You can create a pull request on the repository or just DM Rivu about it.

      <h3>CHARACTER CREATION</h3>
      <h4>Creation Steps</h4>
      <div id="steps">
        [TODO]
      </div>
      <h4>Stats</h4>
      Each creature has <b>abilities</b>:
      <ul id="abilities">
        <li id="awareness"><b>Awareness</b>:
          A creature with high Awareness is always prepared and quick to react, whether through honed instinct or keen senses.
          High Awareness makes a creature more likely to [go first](initiative) in combat and [dodge incoming attacks](Armor_Class).
        </li>
        <li id="finesse"><b>Finesse</b>:
          A creature with high Finesse is accurate and has great attention to detail.
          High Finesse makes a creature more likely to hit with its [attacks](attacks).
        </li>
        <li id="power"><b>Power</b>:
          A creature with high Power has high physical strength.
          High Power makes a creature deal more damage with many physical attacks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      [TODO: Add more abilities.]
      <br/>
      They also have various other <b>stats</b>:
      <ul id="stats">
        <li id="speed"><b>Speed</b> is how far a creature can move on its turn.</li>
        <li id="jump"><b>Jump</b> is how high or far a creature can jump.</li>
        <li id="Armor_Class"><b>Armor Class</b> (AC) is how difficult it is to hit a creature. This is usually equal to 3 + the creature's [Awareness](awareness).</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Species</h4>
      <div id="species">
        A character's species affects many of its starting stats.
        <h5>Slugcat</h5>
        <div id="slugcat">
          <i>Lost in a harsh and indifferent land you must make your own way, with wit and caution as your greatest assets.</i><br/>
          Maximum HP: 10
          Unarmed Attack: 1 + Power damage.
          [TODO: Special stuff.]
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>ADAPTATIONS</h3>
      <div id="adaptations">
        Adaptations are a character's special abilities. The combination of adaptations is what makes a character unique.
        [TODO]
      </div>
      <h3>BASIC RULES</h3>
      <div id="Basic_Rules">
        <h4>Checks and Contests</h4>
        <div id="checks">
          To make a check, roll a six-sided die (1d6) and add the relevant [ability score](abilities), then compare the total to a target number.
          If the check total is equal or greater than the target, the check is successful.
          <div id="Difficulty_Class">For an attack, the target number is the defender's [Armor Class](Armor_Class). Most other checks have a certain <b>Difficulty Class</b>.</div>
        </div>
        <div id="contests">
          In a contest, two creatures both make checks. The creature with the highest total is the winner.
          In case of a tie, the creature that began the contest is the winner.
        </div>
        <h4>Distance</h4>
        <div id="distance">
          In Rainstorm, distance is counted orthogonally. Diagonal moves are always counted as 2.
          <div id="adjacency">Two tiles are <b>adjacent</b> if they touch orthogonally (a distance of 1).</div>
        </div>
        <h4>Falling</h4>
        <div id="falling">
          After landing from a [drop](dropping), a creature takes 1 damage for each tile it fell above 10.
          <div id="Damage_Transfer">If the fall was broken by another creature, half the damage (rounded down) is transferred to it.</div>
        </div>
        <h4>Crafting</h4>
        <div id="crafting">
          [TODO]
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>INVENTORY</h3>
      <div id="inventory">
        Characters can carry [items](items) using these inventory slots:
        <ul id="Character_Inventory">
          <li>Two hand slots, which can each carry a small or medium item. If you have at least one hand, you can also use all your hand slots to carry a large item.</li>
          <li>One mouth slot, which can carry a small item.</li>
        </ul>
        You can manage your inventory by taking these [actions](actions):
        <ul id="Inventory_Actions">
          <li>Drop an item from a hand slot, placing it in your space. If you aren't on a [safe](Safe_Tile) tile, it will fall until it reaches one.</li>
          <li>Pick up an item from your space or an item [embedded](embedding) in an [adjacent](adjacency) tile.</li>
        </ul>
        Non-character creatures don't have any inventory slots by default.
      </div>
      <h3>COMBAT</h3>
      <div id="combat">
        Rainstorm's pride. Combat takes place on a 2D map with one horizontal and one vertical dimension.
        <h4>Combat Flow</h4>
        <div id="Combat_Flow">
          A combat usually follows these steps:
          <ol>
            <li id="initiative">At the start of combat, each creature makes an [Awareness](awareness) [check](checks). The total becomes their <b>Initiative</b> for the combat. Players win Initiative ties.</li>
            <li>Each creature acts in order of Initiative, highest to lowest.</li>
            <li>After all creatures have acted, the next round starts. Step 2 repeats until the combat is over.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <h4>Turn Flow</h4>
        <div id="Turn_Flow">
          <span id="actions">Each creature has two actions to spend on their turn.</span>
          They can also move a number of tiles equal to their [Speed](speed).
          Creatures usually can't take actions or move outside of their own turn.
        </div>
        <h4>Movement</h4>
        <div id="movement">
          A creature can move up, left, or right by spending 1 tile of [movement](speed). If the destination is [unsafe](Safe_Tile), the move <b>also</b> costs 1 tile of [jump height](jump).
          <div id="dropping">To move down, a creature's only option is to <b>fall</b>, moving downwards until it reaches a pole or [safe](Safe_Tile) tile. If the fall was stopped by a safe tile, the creature also risks [fall damage](falling).</div>
          <div id="space">A creature can move through an allied creature's space but cannot stop there. However, one tile can contain any number of items, including corpses.</div>
        </div>
        <h4>Attacks</h4>
        <div id="attacks">
          An attack is a special kind of [Finesse](finesse) [check](checks) against the target's AC. Attacks come in two types: melee and projectile.
          <div id="Melee_Attacks">
            <b>Melee</b> attacks target one creature within a certain [distance](distance). If the check succeeds, the attack hits it.
            "Strike:" effects of items trigger on a melee hit.
            <h5>Unarmed Attacks</h5>
            <div id="unarmed">
              Any creature can make a melee attack by spending one [action](actions). The damage dealt depends on the type of creature that used it, noted in each creature's description.
            </div>
          </div>
          <br/>
          <div id="Projectile_Attacks">
            <b>Projectile</b> attacks are launched in a straight line. For each creature in the line, if the check equals or beats its [AC](Armor_Class), the attack hits it.
            If the projectile hits a solid object that blocks movement, it hits it and stops.
            <h5>Damage Falloff</h5>
            <div id="falloff">
              If the projectile misses the first creature in the line, it continues to the next one, using the same Finesse check for each target.
              For every 20 [distance](distance) between the projectile's source and target, the check's total is reduced by 1.
              (For example, a slugcat throws a spear at a lizard 10 distance away. The check's result is 4 and the lizard's AC is 6, so it continues on and targets another lizard 50 distance away with an AC of 3. It misses the second lizard because of its -2 distance penalty.)
              If a projectile's Finesse check is reduced to -1 by damage falloff, it is destroyed if it is not an item.
            </div>
            <h5>Thrown Items</h5>
            <div id="Thrown_Items">
              Any item can be used as a projectile. The item travels to the location of the creature or object it hit, or one tile away from the solid tile it hit.
              "Impact:" effects of items trigger on a ranged hit.
              Instead of being destroyed by damage falloff, the item stops in place.
              After the attack is finished, the item will usually fall from its new location.
              <div id="embedding">
                Some items <b>embed</b>. These items will move with the creature, object, or tile they hit, and can be picked up from any [adjacent](adjacency) tiles.
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

      <h3>TREASURY</h3>

          Lizards are one of the most common creatures in Rain World. Their various subspecies are found all across the world.<br/>
          All lizards have the ability <b>Armored Head</b>:<br/>
          <ul id="Armored_Head">
            <li>At the start of the lizard's turn, it chooses left or right.</li>
