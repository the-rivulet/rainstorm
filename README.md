# Rainstorm
Rainstorm is a Rain World TTRPG created by Rivu. It is designed to be intuitive and extensible, allowing for diverse strategies without being unnecessarily complex.
It is based on Monsoon (view book [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzTmmMGFaIGbE8kf-QR5wNup7WUS8dciCVOHrH06bPY/edit)) and will probably feel somewhat similar if you have played that before.
